# My Research
- According to my research, students' goals are often influenced by their significant other. This aligns with my family goal, since my significant other also wants to get married when I am done school. 
- My goals of achieving more than one degree is similar to other students, who strive to out-perform their peers. I am a competitive person, and I am driven by getting the highest marks.
- My goals: finishing school, finding a good-paying job, getting married, and starting a family are comparable to the goals of 518 Australian university students aged 18–25. The students sought a traditional life style and proved that they did not live carefree lives. 
- Just like the Australian students, I want to grow up and become a successful and content person.
